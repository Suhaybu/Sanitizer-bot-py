## Introduction

Sanitizer is a simple bot that uses regex to identify links for social platforms and replaces them with discord embed friendly links that allows you to view the content of the link without ever having to leave the discord app. You might think this is a bot for lazy people, but I assure you, if you give it a try, you'll never want to go back.

The bot is developed in Python using the `interactions.py` library. Click [here](https://github.com/interactions-py/interactions.py) for their GitHub repo. This GitHub repo is utilized for version control and the assistance of GitHub Copilot has been used for creating examples of implementation from documentations.
